Welcome to **Work Hub** — a collection of code files that highlight the programming languages I’ve used in various projects and assignments.

This repository is not meant for full projects but to demonstrate my comfort with different programming environments and syntaxes.

Feel free to explore the files to get a sense of how I apply each language in real scenarios.
